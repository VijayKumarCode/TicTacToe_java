🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe: Ubuntu GUI Edition

A modular, industry-standard Tic-Tac-Toe application built with Java Swing. This project showcases high-level software engineering principles including the MVC pattern, Minimax AI, and Unit Testing.
🚀 Project Overview

This application provides a professional gameplay flow designed to demonstrate robust user state handling and UI navigation:

    Registered Mode: Captures user credentials via UserLoginPanel, preserves the username, and transitions to the game board.

    Guest Mode: Allows instant "one-click" play against the AI Agent using an anonymous session.

🪙 The "Toss Authority" Feature

The winner of the randomized pre-game toss is granted the power to decide the opening strategy via a custom TossDialog:

    Play First: Assigns the player "X" and the first move.

    Pass Turn: Assigns the player "O" and allows the AI to open the game.
    
# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Project

A professional, MVC-patterned Tic-Tac-Toe application featuring a Minimax-based AI, user authentication, and persistent leaderboards. Built and deployed on Ubuntu using Amazon Corretto 17.

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

### 1. Component-Based UI
The **View** is split into specialized, reusable components to ensure high maintainability and loose coupling:
* **BoardPanel**: Dedicated to rendering the 3x3 grid and managing button events.
* **ScoreBoardPanel**: Tracks and displays real-time match statistics and player scores.
* **TossDialog**: A custom modal interface that implements the "Toss Authority" logic.

### 2. Robust State Management
The implementation of `GameState.java` allows the `GameController` to track whether the match is **Active**, **Paused**, or **Terminal** (Win/Draw) completely independent of the UI state. This follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

### 3. Unit Testing (QA Focused)
The inclusion of `BoardTest.java` demonstrates a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** mindset. This ensures that:
* All 8 win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) are verified.
* Draw logic and board-full states are handled without regression.
* The core game logic remains stable as the UI evolves.
